instant-layer is a Go code generator designed to quickly scaffold the base structure of microservices. (and even more in the future!)

By defining a service configuration in Go, instant-layer automatically generates the necessary files for an HTTP server, including database configuration, routing, and handler placeholders.

## How to Use
To generate a new service, import the instant-layer packages (primarily files) and define your configuration. The generator's own main.go file serves as an excellent usage example:
